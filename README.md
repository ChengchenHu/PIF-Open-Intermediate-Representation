PIF Open IR: Experimental Framework
===================================

This repository contains code related to ongoing work on Intermediate
Representations (IRs) within the Protocol Independent Forwarding (PIF)
context.  These IRs sit in a compilation flow between (protocol independent)
high-level languages for describing packet processing (forwarding) and
target architectures that implement packet processing.

PIF Open IR is an Open Source SDN (opensourcesdn.org) project.

Results from the project feed into the PIF working group within the
Specfications area of the Open Networking Foundation (opennetworking.org).


Documentation
=============

The docs directory contains documents and presentations related
to the overall work of the project.


Software
========

The pif_ir directory contains source code, examples, and documentation,
