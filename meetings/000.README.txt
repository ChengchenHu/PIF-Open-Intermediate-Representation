PIF Records
===========

The PIF group was formed as an Open Networking Foundation (ONF) working
group, and initially met under the ONF antitrust and intellectual policies.
The first meeting was on 16 September 2014, and the final meeting under
ONF policies was on 28 April 2015.  The agendas and any notes from these
meetings are not included here, but are archived in an ONF repository.
With the agreement of their originators, various presentations from these
meetings are made available here as an information source.

The group has been an Open Software SDN (OSSDN) project since then, and
meets under the OSSDN meeting guidelines.  The first such meeting was
on 19 May 2015.  The agendas and presentations from these meetings are
included here.
